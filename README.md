# Titanic
This project is a based of off the challange from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).
The learning training and testing data was also provided by Kaggle.

The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that checks who was more likely to survive the shipwreck of the Titanic.

The code will be written in python, using the pandas (possibly some others as well, but don't know what yet) library.
